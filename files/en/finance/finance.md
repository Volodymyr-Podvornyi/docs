Finance
=======

The finance module is the most important part of the Splynx billing system. It is the home of billing for all customers in the system and here, we can execute bulk actions.

Splynx has Prepaid and Recurring billing engines. Defining which billing engine each customer will be using is mandatory for charging customers for services. Defining customers billing types is done in _Customer → Billing → Billing overview_.
