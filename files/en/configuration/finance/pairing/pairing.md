Pairing
=============

Before processing Bank statements, it is necessary to define pairing parameters first. The bank statement processing feature allows you reconcile payments receivable with invoices issued by pairing them, so it can proceed multiple payments.

To configure Paring click on `Config → Finance → Pairing`.
