Pairing
=============

Before processing Payment statements, it is necessary to define pairing parameters first. The payment statement processing feature allows you reconcile payments receivable with invoices issued by pairing them, so it can proceed multiple payments at once.

To configure Paring click on `Config → Finance → Pairing`.
