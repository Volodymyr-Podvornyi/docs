Payment methods listed here are set by default. When you install a new payment module(ex. SageOne, Netcash, Stripe etc.) it will automatically appear here.  

You can add a new Payment method manually by clicking the *Add* icon at the top-right corner of the page.  The window will appear where you will type the name of the Payment Method and enable the option *"Active"*.
