PPTP Connection between Splynx and Mikrotik
==========

It is possible to have a PPTP connection between some router and Splynx but it's not recommended. In Splynx we do not use PPTP links anymore because of weak security.

We recommend to use built-in OpenVPN server instead - [OpenVPN server](../../configuration/tools/openvpn/openvpn.md)

If you really need a PPTP link please contact Splynx support.
