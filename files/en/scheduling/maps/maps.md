It is possible to filter the mapped tasks by **Project**, **Partner**, **Priorities**, **Scheduling status**, **Assignee**, **Creation date** or search it with the key words. If the filter is not applied, the map will show tasks created in the period: from 2 weeks ago to the current date.

All tasks have different markers according to the priority.
