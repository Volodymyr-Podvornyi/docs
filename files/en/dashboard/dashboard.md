Dashboard
=========

### Shortcuts

![Screenshot](shortcuts.png)

On this panel can be configured and pinned the quick actions available in Splynx. The list of actions depends on the role of the account. Note, when we install at least one add-on on the system, the `Install add-ons` item will change to `Configure modules` one.

**Example:**

We can navigate to `Config → Integrations → Add-ons`, find the necessary add-on and click on `Install`, but it's faster to click on `Install add-ons` action in *Shortcuts* panel.
