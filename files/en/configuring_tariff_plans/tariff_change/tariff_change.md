Tariff Change
========

This feature can be used to change a tariff in the system, regardless of how many customers are subscribed to it. This feature is used for mass changes as its functionality is to change the plan selected with another plan on the system for all customers subscribed to the plan.

The concept is similar to that of the ["Change service"](finance/change_service/change_service.md) button found in "Customer services", only here, this button applies the change to all customers subscribed to the plan.

This feature is available to use for all types of tariff's in the system to conveniently change the tariff for all customers using it, the feature can be used by clicking on the "Change plan" button in the *Actions* column of each respective tariff table:

You then need to select the following parameters:

* **New plan start date** - select the date to apply the change of plan for all customers using this plan.

* **New plan** - select the new plan to change to from the list of available plans in the drop down list, if desired, plans can be created prior to using this feature.

* **Ignore balance** - enabling this option will ignore the balance of the current plan for each of the customers registered to this plan.


Upon specifying these parameters, the plan description and price will appear, and the "Preview" button will become available.
