In this section we can view logs of finance elements that have been modified, added or deleted on the system.

In order to properly categorize these elements by Splynx it is necessary to configure the relations between *accounting categories* and *transaction categories*. This can be done in `Config / Finance / Accounting categories`.

Each of the tabs in this section display the relevant data to the *Customers, Invoices and Payments* and can be filtered according to customer id/invoice number/receipt number, period of time, payment status etc.

Like all tables in Splynx, the table can be modified to display fields of your choice with the breadcrumbs <icon class="image-icon">![view_icon3.png](view_icon3.png)</icon> icon at the bottom of the table or exported in a format of choice with the export <icon class="image-icon">![view_icon2.png](view_icon2.png)</icon> icon.
